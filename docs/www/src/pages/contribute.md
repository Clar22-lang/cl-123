# Add Project To Showcase

Start by reading our [Contributors Guide](https://github.com/microsoft/static-web-apps-gallery-code-samples/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) and our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/microsoft/static-web-apps-gallery-code-samples/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). If you still want to contribute, check the requirements for adding a new project, then follow the Process to make your submission.

## Requirements

We want to feature useful examples of Static Web Apps sites in action.
 * The site must be deployed using Azure Static Web Apps.
 * The site must be live (active) and functional at submission time.
 * The site must showcase some key feature or use case (beyond boilerplate)

Bonus Features:
 * The site has a custom domain.
 * The app is deployed in production.
 * The app uses a new framework or generator (first example)

---

## Process

[**Visit this link**](https://github.com/microsoft/static-web-apps-gallery-code-samples/edit/master/docs/www/src/data/users.tsx) and fork the project.
* Follow instructions in the `data/users.tsx` file
* Don't forget to add relevant screenshots in `data/showcase`
* Be respectful of others content when naming your files
* Submit the PR for approval.

## Maintenance

If your app status changes at any time, please  update the submission entry (or delete it and related screenshots, if no longer compliant to requirements). Your help in keeping this repository relevant is much appreciated.

## Archived Tag

We will periodically verify the links associated with a project submission to ensure they are active and accessible. If a provided source or deployment link fails, that project will be tagged `archived` in the Showcase. We reserve the right to remove or de-prioritize display of archived projects in the future.
